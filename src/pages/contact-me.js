// Step 1: Import React
import * as React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

// Step 2: Define your component
const ContactMe =    () => {
  return (
    <Layout pageTitle="Contact Me">
      <p>You cannot contact me. Communication is impossible. The void between us is too big. We are born alone and we die alone. Another change.</p>
    </Layout>
  )
}

// Step 3: Export your component
export default ContactMe
